## Overview

Growcally is a scallable, accessibile and secure full stack application developed with AWS, React, Typescript, Tailwind, Node, Express and PostgreSQL.

## What I've achieved

- Improved security of sensitive user information and reduced chances of hacking by authenticating and authorising users based on access tokens and user information managed with AWS Cognito as well as limiting allowed access to the server via CORS.
- Achieved secure and efficient image storage, scalable request handling and data management using with AWS S3 bucket, Node.js, Express.js, Prisma and PostgreSQL.
- Designed and created user-friendly and responsive UI for all screen sizes with over 90% accessibility rate by using React, Redux, Typescript, Tailwind and Lighthouse evaluation.
- Achieved stable and smooth app operations by conducting automated unit and integration tests using React-testing-library, Jest and Mock service worker and built CI/CD piplines using GitHub Actions and Render.
- Significantly improved scalability and reduced data inconsistency risk in the backend system by creating a production-only database, and managing secrets and configs with Doppler.

## Background

### Problems

- Almost all the existing garden apps are 'individuals': apps for improving garderning skills and managing watering routine...etc. But growing vegetables are also a social activity. Urban growers all over the world have proven that 'growing with others' can make gardening more enjoyable and productive.
- Sticky cost of living crisis: Increasing number of people are now squeezing their budget on food. Retailers are raising prices of vegetables. While growing food at home could mitigate the pressure, many people haven't even thought of giving it a go.

### Solutions (Main Features of this App)

- Create a social app where home growers can share the progress of their garden projects and their skills with others, which encourage more gardening and skill and resource sharing among the users.
