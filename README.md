## What I've achieved

- Improved security of sensitive user information and reduced chances of hacking by authenticating and authorising users based on access tokens and user information managed with AWS Cognito as well as limiting allowed access to the server via CORS.
- Achieved secure and efficient image storage, scalable request handling and data management using with AWS S3 bucket, Node.js, Express.js, Prisma and PostgreSQL.
- Designed and created user-friendly and responsive UI for all screen sizes with over 90% accessibility rate by using React, Redux, Typescript, Tailwind and Lighthouse evaluation.
- Achieved stable and smooth app operations by conducting automated testing using React-testing-library and Jest.
- Significantly improved scalability and reduced data inconsistency risk in the backend system by creating a production-only database, and managing secrets and configs with Doppler.
